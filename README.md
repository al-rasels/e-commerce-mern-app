# E-Commerce Backend API

This repository implements a backend system for an e-commerce platform, developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The project emphasizes scalable architecture, modular design, and efficient data handling for modern e-commerce platforms.

## Abstract

The **E-Commerce Backend API** is designed to handle essential functionalities required for an e-commerce application, such as user authentication, product management, order processing, and more. The system leverages a RESTful architecture and provides comprehensive support for integration with front-end frameworks.

The project demonstrates the application of Computer Science principles such as:
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizing MongoDB for non-relational data storage.
- **Concurrency Control**: Managing simultaneous API calls.
- **Authentication & Security**: Role-based access control using JWT.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture for system expansion.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Authentication**: Implements secure user registration and login with password hashing.
- **Product Management**: APIs for creating, updating, and querying product listings.
- **Order Fulfillment**: Endpoints for order creation, tracking, and payment status updates.
- **Shopping Cart**: Support for adding, updating, and removing items from user-specific carts.
- **Wishlist**: Enables users to manage their preferred items.

### Administrative Features
- **Admin Dashboard API**: Provides endpoints to manage user roles, products, and orders.
- **Data Analytics Preparation**: API support for generating sales and user behavior metrics.

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher  
- **MongoDB**: Version 5.0 or higher  
- **NPM**: Version 8.x or higher  
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Setup and Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following entries:

```env
PORT=8000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

### Database Initialization
To initialize the database with default data:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### Running the Application
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
